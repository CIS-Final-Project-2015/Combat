# Combat
#Combat team repository

    #We have the combat order set and it send it out as the orderd list without the numbers.
#We also have it pulling from an outside fource, witch lets us use any information sent from Entities.


    #The program can check to see if the player is able to fight or not, and weather a monster is alive or not.
#If the monster is not alive it is removed from a list that we cheked.
#We still need actual data from Entities and Encounters. Once we have that, we can check all of our code.
