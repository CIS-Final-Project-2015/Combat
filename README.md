# Combat

#Combat team repository


We have the combat order set and it send it out as the orderd list without the numbers.
We also have it pulling from an outside fource, witch lets us use any information sent from Entities.


The program can check to see if the player is able to fight or not, and weather a monster is alive or not.
If the monster is not alive it is removed from a list that we cheked.
We still need actual data from Entities and Encounters. Once we have that, we can check all of our code.

We have the damage done, and the target selected
We have it to where the players can select the target without problems
We need actual data so we can test evrything.

#Update 3/25/2015

The critical works with the testing factors, but not with actual data (Because we have none to test)

Also there are some new files, like testPlayers.py. It is for more testing purpeses. 

We will need at least one official test encounter and 4 official created characters. After that, testing begins.
